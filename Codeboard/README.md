# ⌨️ Codeboard – Coding Keyboard for Developers

Codeboard is a **custom Android coding keyboard (IME)** designed to make coding on mobile devices easier, faster, and more developer-friendly.

Unlike standard keyboards, Codeboard focuses on **programming-specific keys and IDE-like behavior**, helping developers write and edit code efficiently on smartphones.
