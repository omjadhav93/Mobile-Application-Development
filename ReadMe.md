# 📱 Mobile App Development Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of **mobile app development practice projects** created to strengthen fundamentals, experiment with Android concepts, and build real, usable features through hands-on coding.

Each project focuses on different aspects of mobile app development such as UI design, user interaction, app logic, lifecycle handling, and custom implementations. The goal of this repository is **learning by building**, not just tutorials.
